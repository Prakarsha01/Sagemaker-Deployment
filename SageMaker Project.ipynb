    "\n",
    "Now that the model is trained, testing is necessary to assess its performance. Currently, the model accepts input in the form of `review_length, review[500]`, where `review[500]` represents a sequence of `500` integers describing the words in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Thankfully, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with such simple inputs.\n",

    "However, one requirement is to provide a function to load the saved model. This function, named `model_fn()`, should take a path to the directory containing the model artifacts as its only parameter. This function must also exist in the Python file specified as the entry point. Fortunately, the model loading function has already been provided, requiring no further changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** When running the built-in inference code, it must import the `model_fn()` method from the `train.py` file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard (i.e., `if __name__ == '__main__':`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since no changes are needed in the uploaded code during training, the current model can be deployed as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** When deploying a model, SageMaker launches a compute instance that remains active until you shut it down. It's crucial to be aware of this because the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on its running duration.\n",
